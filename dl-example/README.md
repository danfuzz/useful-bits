Dynamic Library Loading Example
===============================

This is a small but complete example, written in C, which shows:

* How to build a host executable into which a dynamic library can be loaded.
* How to build a dynamic library with intentional holes.
* How to load and use such a library within a host runtime, using the
  `dlsym()` family of functions.

This is the sort of thing that needs to be done in a general
language runtime that supports runtime loading of additional
libraries.

In this case, the `host` executable exports a function named
`hook`, and it expects each library to export a function called
`run`. You run `host` passing it the file names of one or more
libraries. It opens each library, looks up the `run` function,
and calls it.

The code has been tested on OS X (compiled with Clang) and Linux (compiled
with Gcc and Clang, and running in a Gnu environment).


Subdirectories of this project
------------------------------

* `etc` &mdash; Miscellaneous support files.

* `host` &mdash; The `host` executable.

* `all-good` &mdash; Library example. It is a proper library, importing `hook`,
  exporting `run`, and defining library constructor and destructor functions.

* `missing-export` &mdash; Library example. It should succeed in loading
  and initializing, but it should fail to run, because it does not export
  the symbol `run`. The host always tries to look that symbol up.

* `missing-import` &mdash; Library example. It should fail to load, because it
  attempts to import the symbol `notFound`, which is not exported by the
  host.

* `weak-import` &mdash; Library example. It is a proper library despite the fact
  that it attempts to import the symbol `notFound`, which is not exported
  by the host. It succeeds, because it declares the symbol reference as
  "weak", which means that it gets set to `NULL` when the library is loaded.


Testing
-------

To test the code, run the `test` script in the base directory of
the project. You should see something like this:

```
$ ./test
Building: host
Building: all-good
Building: missing-import
Building: missing-export
Building: weak-import
Done!

./all-good/all-good.lib: Loading
>>> init() called inside all-good.
./all-good/all-good.lib: Running
>>> run() called inside all-good.
./all-good/all-good.lib: Closing
>>> shutdown() called inside all-good.
./all-good/all-good.lib: Done.

./missing-export/missing-export.lib: Loading
>>> init() called inside missing-export.
./missing-export/missing-export.lib: Running
Trouble looking up `run`: dlsym(0x7fe2c9c03940, run): symbol not found
./missing-export/missing-export.lib: Closing
>>> shutdown() called inside missing-export.
./missing-export/missing-export.lib: Done.

./missing-import/missing-import.lib: Loading
./missing-import/missing-import.lib: Trouble loading: dlopen(./missing-import/missing-import.lib, 6): Symbol not found: _notFound
  Referenced from: ./missing-import/missing-import.lib
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in ./missing-import/missing-import.lib

./weak-import/weak-import.lib: Loading
>>> init() called inside weak-import.
./weak-import/weak-import.lib: Running
>>> run() called inside weak-import.
>>> Properly found that `notFound == NULL`.
./weak-import/weak-import.lib: Closing
>>> shutdown() called inside weak-import.
./weak-import/weak-import.lib: Done.
```

If you have multiple C compilers available, you can select which one to
use by setting the `${CC}` environment variable before running, e.g.:

```shell
$ CC=clang ./test
```
