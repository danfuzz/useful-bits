How to contribute to this project
=================================

Here are some guidelines for contributing to this project.

Bug Reports
-----------

If you wish to file a bug report, please use the project's issue
tracker on GitHub. Ideally, your bug report will include the following
information:

* A brief summary of the problem, of just one or two sentences.

* Explicit steps to reproduce the problem. This should be complete
  and self-contained.

* What you expected to happen when you run the steps-to-reproduce.

* What you observed actually happening when you run the steps-to-reproduce.
  Include a shell console transcript.

* What version of the project you are using.

* What operating environment you are using the project in
  (OS, version, C compiler, etc.).

For your convenience, you can copy-and-paste this template, when going
to fill out a bug report. Remove the `[bracketed]` text, and replace it
with your own words and/or code.

fields.

Code Patches
------------

If you want to contribute code changes to the project, here is what
to do:

* *First and foremost* make sure that there is an issue (bug report
  or feature request) that covers the change you want to make. See
  above for details about filing an issue if there is not yet one.

* If you have not already done so, file a separate issue stating:

  ```
  I hereby assert:

  * I am licensing all code I contribute to this project, under the
    stated terms of this project's license.

  * All code I contribute is my own original work.

  * I have permission to contribute to this project under these terms.

  Signed,
  [your real name]
  ```

  **If you are not willing to do this, then your code will not be
  accepted into the project.**

* Using the standard Git and GitHub workflow, fork the project, create
  one or more commits that address the issue in question, and submit the
  resulting commit history as a pull request.

  Please keep each commit self-consistent and self-contained. When in
  doubt, send a pull request that consists of a single squashed commit
  of all your changes, and make sure the commit message is a clean
  description of everything that you did.

* Limit each pull request to addressing just one issue.
