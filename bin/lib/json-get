    Usage:

    ${name} [<opt> ...] [--] <json-value> [<assignment> ...] [--]
    [<jq-expression> ...]
      Performs an operation on a single JSON value (at least with typical
      usage). More specifically, <json-value> is used as the sole input to
      a `json-val` invocation consisting of the rest of the arguments. If
      no expression is given, it is taken to be `.`, which will end up just
      formatting the input value as implied/specified by the output options.

      --output=<style>
        `compact` -- Output in compact (single line) JSON form.
        `json` -- Output in multiline JSON form. This is the default.
        `lines` -- Output each item as a single line. Similar to `raw`, except
          that strings with newlines or CRs in them get treated as non-raw so as
          to maintain the guarantee of item-per-line.
        `raw` -- Output strings as raw text (and other values as `compact`).
        `words` -- Like `lines`, except that the guarantee is a word per line.
          As such, strings containing whitespace get treated as non-raw.

    ${name} [--help | -h]
      Displays this message.
