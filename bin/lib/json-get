    Usage:

    ${name} [<opt> ...] [--] <json-value> [<assignment> ...] [--]
    [<jq-expression> ...]
      Performs an operation on a single JSON value (at least with typical
      usage). More specifically, <json-value> is used as the sole input to
      a `json-val` invocation consisting of the rest of the arguments. If
      no expression is given, it is taken to be `.`, which will end up just
      formatting the input value as implied/specified by the output options.

      --compact
        Output in compact (not multiline) JSON form.
      --json
        Output in JSON form. This is the default.
      --lines
        Output each item as a single line. Similar to `--raw`, except that
        a strings with newlines or CRs in them get treated as non-raw so as
        to maintain the guarantee of item-per-line.
      --raw
        Output raw strings (and other values compactly).
      --words
        Like `--lines`, except that the guarantee is a word per line. As such,
        strings with any whitespace get treated as non-raw.

    ${name} [--help | -h]
      Displays this message.
